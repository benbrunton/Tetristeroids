Space Rebel game

Todo:

game class should poll level to allow dynamic loading of npc elements
end of levels should have a star wars style vertical scroll
abstract block renderer
when (e.g. asteroids) things break up only the central part should persist
levels should have proximity based events
levels should have proximity based messages
levels should be able to calculate own end (instead of relying on proximity)
prevent unfeasible ships
save player state and current level to localStorage
multibrowser support
kongregate api
achievements
enemies
more instruction
grappling hook
collectables
better hud
level intros
crew
animate engines during thrust
messages so we can have opening credits in first level
glider (Conways Game Of Life) enemies

Level ideas
precision parking with reasonably good collision detection
